# I-NTMCP

Implementation of the Interactive Nested Tree Monte-Carlo Planning (I-NTMCP)
algorithm for online planning in I-POMDPs.


## Installation

I-NTMCP is implemented using Python 3.9.

As with any python seperate python library, project, etc, we recommend
installing I-NTMCP in a seperate virtual environment such as those provided by [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/).

1. Download or clone the repo.

2. Install I-NTMCP using PIP by navigating to the `i-ntmcp` root directory (the one containing the `setup.py` file), and running:

```
pip install -e .

# use the following to install all dependencies (including for search tree
visualization, pygraphviz)
pip install -e .[all]
```
